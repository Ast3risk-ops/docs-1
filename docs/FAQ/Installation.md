# Frequently Asked Questions

* **Will I keep my data? Do I have to reinstall?**
  If you are currently on atlas, you will have to reinstall. However, after installing the new version you will not need to reinstall. For future updates, you can simply update in a similar way to standard windows updates.

* **Will it be open source?**
  The wizard will be open source under MIT license.

* **Can I tweak it more?**
  Just like before, further tweaking is not recommended as it can cause unforseen issues.

* **Are you going to provide an iso?**
  No, if you weren't there for the rundown of the installation process, you will download a default 22H2 windows iso, download the wizard and run the playbook to convert the installation into atlas.
  To elaborate, the wizard is the new program which modifies your live install just like NTLite, and a playbook is instructions for the wizard.

* **So it's an optimizer?**
  No, the wizard is much, much, more than an optimizer. It is quite literally replicating what was done before with the NTLite tool except on a live install.

* **Will there be windows 11?**
  Not right now, but yes.

* **What's now supported?**

    * FACEIT
    * FIFA
    * Modern Warfare 2/Warzone
    * Hogwarts Legacy
    * Oculus VR
    * Network Discovery, SMB, Mobile Hotspot
    * More!

* **Can I dualboot?**
  Yes

* **Can the playbook be reverted?**
  Right now, no. It is a very complex process but right now you can use the setup.exe within a default windows iso to restore original behavior of windows.

* **Do I need internet?**
  Yes, internet is required as components such as .NET 3.5 and VCRedists require internet to be downloaded. There may be workarounds for this in the future but right now internet is required to run the playbook.
  Running your own playbook does not require internet unless you specify it is required.
