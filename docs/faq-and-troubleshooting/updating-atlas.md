# :material-microsoft-windows: How do I update AtlasOS to the latest version?

**If you're running a Atlas Playbook version v0.2.0 or below, you can NOT update to the latest Atlas version, or update Windows.**

Some changes that older Atlas versions made were irreversible, meaning that updating to the latest version of Atlas does not 'reverse' those changes, such as adding back Windows Defender or Windows Update.

Previous versions of Atlas [have security concerns](../atlas-and-security/#legacy-versions-of-atlas), which only increases with old installations that will forever remain unpatched. These versions of Atlas are no longer supported, lack features, and lack many bug fixes.
