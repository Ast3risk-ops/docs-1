# :material-head-check: Who is Atlas designed for?

**Atlas is for any enthusiast looking to improve the privacy, performance, and ease of use of their Windows installation.**

We're on a mission to make a modification of Windows which *mostly* everyone can use, with the least amount of drawbacks. We only recommend installing Atlas on computers that you fully own and are not managed by any other entity.

Atlas aims for the best compatibility and modifications possible, but you should be prepared to troubleshoot any potential issues. Although unlikely, you should also be prepared to reinstall Windows. This isn't always suitable for everyone.

Keep in mind that Atlas is always improving with each new version, meaning that the likelihood of issues should be constantly going down.
