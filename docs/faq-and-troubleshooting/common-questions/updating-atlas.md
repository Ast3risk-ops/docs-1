# :material-microsoft-windows: How do I update AtlasOS to the latest version?

**If you're running an Atlas Playbook version v0.2.0 or below, you can NOT update to the latest Atlas version, or update Windows.**

The latest version of Atlas supports cumulative Windows Updates, but feature updates are currently disabled due to common resetting of Atlas' customizations.

## What should I do on an older version then?

Many changes that older Atlas versions made were irreversible, meaning that updating to the latest version of Atlas does not revert those changes. This makes for an unsupported configuration and causes stability issues.

Previous versions of Atlas [have security concerns](atlas-and-security.md#legacy-versions-of-atlas), which only increase over time due to a lack of Windows Updates. These versions of Atlas are no longer supported, lack features, and lack many bug fixes.
