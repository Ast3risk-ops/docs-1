## Group Policy Editor

!!! warning 
    Automatic driver installation cannot be disabled on Windows Home edition. This feature is controllable only in the Windows Pro edition.

It's not that the Group Policy Editor is missing in the Windows Home edition, but rather, many of the policies it controls do not apply to the Home edition. This means that even if it was present, you wouldn't have the same level of customization and control over system settings as you would with Windows Pro.

## Other Differences

Here are some other differences between Windows Home and Pro editions:

- Windows Pro includes features like BitLocker encryption, Remote Desktop, and Hyper-V virtualization, which are not available in Windows Home.
- Windows Pro supports Remote Desktop Connection, allowing you to connect to your computer remotely from another device.
