# :simple-roblox: Why is Roblox not opening?

**There is currently two workarounds for this, which involves enabling TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot and creating an User Account and installing roblox there.**

Follow the steps below to fix the problem.

### 1. Enabling TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot

!!! Note 

    If you're using Windows 11, chances are you've already got TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot turned on. If that's the case, skip this step and move on to the next one.

To enable TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot, you need to access the BIOS of your computer and enable "TPM 2.0" (or "Trusted Platform Model") and "Secure Boot".

Refer to your motherboard's manual if you don't know the key for it.

### 2. Creating a New Local Account and Installing Roblox

- Navigate to `Settings > Accounts > Other Accounts > Add Account` to create a new local account.

- Sign out of your current account and log into the newly created one.

- Transfer all your data (Desktop, Downloads, etc.) from the old user account to the new one.

- Install Roblox as you normally would.

- After ensuring all your data has been successfully transferred, you may delete the old user account.

!!! warning

    Be sure to verify that all your important data has been moved before deleting the old account.
