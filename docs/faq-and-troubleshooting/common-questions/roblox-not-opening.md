# :simple-roblox: Why is Roblox not opening?

**There is currently two workarounds for this, which involves enabling TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot, creating an User Account and installing roblox there. Follow the steps below to fix the problem**

# :material-cog: Enabling TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot

**If you are on 11, you probably already have TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot enabled, so skip this step if you already have it enabled**

To enable TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot, you need to access the BIOS of your computer (refer to your motherboard's manual if you don't know the key for it) and enable "TPM 2.0" (or "Trusted Platform Model") and "Secure Boot".

# :material-account-supervisor-outline: Creating a new Local Account and installing roblox on it

To create a new Local Account, go to Settings > Accounts > Other Accounts > Add Account. After that, sign out of your account and enter the new one. Once that's finished, move all your data from the old user account to the new one (Desktop, Downloads, etc...) and then just install Roblox normally. After moving all your data, you can delete the old user account.
