**It's because your current Windows build is not supported by Atlas.**

The only way to fix this is to reinstall Windows using the ISO downloaded from the [Installation Guide](../../getting-started/installation.md).

To see if your build matches Atlas' requirements, follow the step below.

1. Check your Windows version. You can do this by Pressing ++win+r++ and run `winver`
2. Compare the window that popped up after excuting with the boxes below.
