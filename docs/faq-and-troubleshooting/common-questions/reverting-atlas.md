# :material-microsoft-windows: How do I revert AtlasOS' changes?

**You'll need to reinstall Windows to revert Atlas' modifications.**

Due to the number of modifications Atlas makes, there is currently no single-click way to revert its changes. Options built into Windows, such as those from Windows Recovery or Advanced Startup, are not recommended because they will not revert all modifications.

To reinstall Windows, follow [Microsoft's guide using installation media](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/reinstall-windows-d8369486-3e33-7d9c-dccc-859e2b022fc7) or another guide using an ISO file/installation media.
