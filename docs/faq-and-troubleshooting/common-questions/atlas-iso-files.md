# Where is the Atlas ISO file?

**Atlas doesn't have an ISO file. It uses AME Wizard to modify Windows on a new live installation, applying configurations like an ISO file.**

Distributing ISO files violates Microsoft's EULA and poses safety risks due to uncertainty about the contents. We use AME Wizard and use releases directly from our GitHub. We also include a checksum in case you wish to verify the integrity of your download.
