# Does Bluetooth work on AtlasOS?

**Yes, Bluetooth is fully functional on Atlas, you can choose to enable or disable it during installation.**

If you're using Atlas and not using Automatic Driver Installation, you will need to install the Bluetooth driver yourself.

These steps will guide you on getting setup with Bluetooth:

1. Enable Bluetooth in the Atlas folder

2. Install your Bluetooth driver (from OEM or via our [SDIO guide](../../getting-started/post-installation/drivers/getting-started.md#snappy-driver-installer-origin))
    - Most issues with Bluetooth are caused by installing improper drivers. Make sure you research and find the driver which is suited for your device.

3. Turn ON Bluetooth, and pair your device

If this did not work, try researching further into the driver you should download for your system. These are almost always the cause and is not an issue directly with Atlas.
