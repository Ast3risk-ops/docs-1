# Advanced Configuration

If you are not confident with your technical ability, it is recommended to avoid this section. Any misinterpretation can result in compatibility issues and other problems. Therefore, it's important to understand what you are doing and how to revert it. This section is intended for advanced users only.

All of the configuration files listed here are located in the `6. Advanced Configuration` folder. In the Atlas folder which is on the Desktop. If you deleted the folder, check [here](../../../faq-and-troubleshooting/common-questions/atlas-folder-missing.md) for how to find it/get it back.
