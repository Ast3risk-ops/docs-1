# Advanced Configuration

If you do not know what you are doing, please skip this section in order not to bring any harm to your PC. Here you can break compatibility and cause general issues, make sure you know what you are doing, and how to revert the changes you make. This section is made for advanced users only.

All of the configuration files listed here are located in the `6. Advanced Configuration` folder. In the Atlas folder which is on the Desktop. If you deleted the folder, check [here](../../../faq-and-troubleshooting/common-questions/atlas-folder-missing.md) for how to find it/get it back.

## UWP

UWP (Universal Windows Platform) is a certain type of application in Windows, also refered to as modern apps, e.g. Settings or Microsoft Store. On Atlas, for people that want the absaloute minimal amount of processes at the cost of **system instability and compatibility**, you can disable it run the `Disable All UWP.cmd` file in the `UWP` folder.

Please note that this is **not recommended or suppported** by Atlas, and the gains from doing this will be minimal to none.

These scripts are aimed at users that have a stripped driver, and people that barely touch the NVIDIA Control Panel.
