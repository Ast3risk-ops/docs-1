# Media

For media, there is obviously the default way to play media using Windows Media Player which to us is the most convient way to play media out of the box. There is also Groove Music which comes built in with Windows and can be opened how you would usually open an app. However, in our software install script we include some other options, which are listed below.

## Groove Music

Groove Music is a built in music app for Windows 10/11 but Atlas removes it for you when you first install. It is available via the Microsoft Store for free. It is useful for playing music, whether that be local or online. It is a bit more advanced than Windows Media Player. There is obviously better choices out there but if you just want an easy to use music software, this is an option. Check it out, [Groove Music](ms-windows-store://pdp/?ProductId=9WZDNCRFJ3PT)
