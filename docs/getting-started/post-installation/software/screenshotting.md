# Screenshotting

For screenshotting, there is obviously the default way to screenshot using ++win+shift+s++ which to us is the most convient way to screenshot out of the box. There is also Snipping tool which comes built in with Windows and can be opened how you would usually open an app. However, in our software install script we include some other options, which are listed below.

## Lightshot

Lightshot is a screenshotting tool that allows you to take screenshots of your screen and edit them. It is lightweight and can run on most computers. Check it out, [Lightshot](https://app.prntscr.com/en/index.html)

## ShareX

ShareX is also a screenshotting tool that allows you to take screenshots of your screen and edit them. Whilst it is comparable to Lightshot, it is less lightweight but because of that it allows more features which allow you to customise your photos further.
