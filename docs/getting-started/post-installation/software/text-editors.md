# Text editors and IDEs

Text editors and IDEs are very useful for programming and writing code. They can also be used for writing documents, but we recommend using a word processor for that. There are many options for text editors and IDEs, and we have listed some below, most are inside of our software install script.

## Notepad

Notepad is a built-in Windows app that allows you to write text. It is useful for writing text, whether that be code or documents. This is the default option for text editors and IDEs, but it sadly doesn't contain as much features as you may need. Due to this being a default Windows application, this isn't in our software install script.

## Notepad++

Notepad++ (also known as the older brother of Notepad) is a text editor that allows you to write text. It is useful for writing text, whether that be code or documents. It is a bit more advanced than Notepad. Notepad++ is also really customisable so you can use it in lots of ways. Check it out, [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).

## Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code (also known as VSCode) is a text editor out of the box, but with some extensions it can turn into a really usefull IDE for developers. It is useful for writing code and text, but we recommend a text editor for text. It is a bit more advanced than Notepad++. Check it out, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## VSCodium

VSCodium is the same as Visual Studio Code, but it is open source and doesn't have the Microsoft branding and telemetry. It is useful for writing code and text, but we recommend a text editor for text. Check it out, [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/).
