# Web Browsers

In Atlas, you can choose between 4 browsers pre-installation that we have chose for user convienience and user-respectiveness. We have compiled a table below so you can decide which browser to pick.

When choosing a browser, we highly recommend to prioritise considering how it respects user privacy. However, also consider other factors, like speed, ease of use and more.
