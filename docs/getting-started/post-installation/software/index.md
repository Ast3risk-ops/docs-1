# Installing Software

## :material-package-down: What is the Windows Package Manager?

Atlas makes it easy to install software by utilizing WinGet.

WinGet is the default Windows package manager by Microsoft installed via the App Installer package on the Microsoft Store, with the software repository ran by the community. It is like apt-get and Homebrew on Linux and macOS respectively. It enables you to install software on your computer from the command line.

## :material-shape-plus-outline: Installing software with WinGet

You can install software we have listed using WinGet by going to the `Desktop/Atlas/1. Install Software` folder and running the `Install Software.ps1` script.

Furthermore, you can install software by typing `winget install <package name>` in the command line. You can find the names of the packages on the [winget.run](https://winget.run) website.
