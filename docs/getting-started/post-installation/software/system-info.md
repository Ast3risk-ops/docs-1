# System Information

System Information helps you see information relating to your system (yes, obviously). It can be useful for debugging and seeing what is going on with your system, or if not debugging then it can help you see what is going on with your system, whether that be temperatures, CPU usage, RAM usage, etc. There are many options for system information software, and we have listed some below, most are inside of our software install script.

## Task Manager

Task Manager is a built-in Windows app that allows you to see what is going on with your system. It is useful for seeing what is going on with your system, whether that be temperatures, CPU usage, RAM usage, etc. It is also useful for debugging and seeing what is going on with your system. This is the default option for system information software, but it sadly doesn't contain as much information as you may need. Due to this being a default Windows application, this isn't in our software install script.

## HWiNFO

HWiNFO is a system information software that allows you to see what is going on with your system. It is useful for seeing what is going on with your system, whether that be temperatures, CPU usage, RAM usage, etc. It is also useful for debugging and seeing what is going on with your system. It is a bit more advanced than Task Manager, and it is also more lightweight. HWiNFO is also really customisable so you can use it in lots of ways. Check it out, [HWiNFO](https://www.hwinfo.com/).

## MSI Afterburner

MSI Afterburner allows for modifications of your system and provides informaton about your system too. Sadly it is more of an overclocking software than an actual information software, so if you want just information this may not be the best choice for you. MSI Afterburner also allows for system stats ingame, like FPS, CPU%, GPU%, RAM usage and others. Check it out, [MSI Afterburner](https://www.msi.com/Landing/afterburner).

## CPU-Z

Allows you to see system information relating to your CPU. It is useful for seeing what is going on with your CPU, whether that be temperatures, CPU usage, etc. It is also useful for debugging and seeing what is going on with your CPU. Check it out, [CPU-Z](https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html).

## GPU-Z

Pretty much the same as CPU-Z but for GPUs. Check it out, [GPU-Z](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpuz/).
