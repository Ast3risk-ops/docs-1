# :custom-intel: Installing Intel graphics drivers

In order of preference, we recommend installing your Intel graphics drivers from:

1. [Intel website](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005629/graphics/processor-graphics.html), using the Manual method.

    Note: Intel 5th Generation Processors and before are not supported by [DCH](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000058295/graphics.html), you must get the graphics driver from the manufacturer website.

2. Your device/motherboard support page, recommended search query: `manufacturer` + `model` + driver. Example: MSI B450-A PRO driver.

3. [Snappy Driver Installer Origin (SDIO)](https://www.glenn.delahoy.com/snappy-driver-installer-origin).
