This is usually because graphics drivers are not installed or improperly installed. To check:

1. windows+r dxdiag
2. If it asks you to check if drivers are digitally signed, click "No".
3. Go to display (if you have multiple "display" tabs or a "render" tab check those also).
4. On the left side, if the "Name" field says "Microsoft Basic Display Adapter", that means you don't have a graphics driver installed.

To install graphics drivers, check out our [guide](../Post%20Installation/Drivers/)!
