# My games are running at EXTREMELY low framerates!

This is usually because graphics drivers are not installed or improperly installed. To check this:

1. Windows Key + R
2. Type **dxdiag**
3. If it asks you to check if drivers are digitally signed, click "No".
4. Go to display (if you have multiple "display" tabs or a "render" tab check those also).
5. On the left side, if the "Name" field says **Microsoft Basic Display Adapter**, that means you don't have a graphics driver installed.

To install graphics drivers, check out our [guide](../Post%20Installation/Drivers/)!
