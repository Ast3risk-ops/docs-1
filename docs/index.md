    We have heard your concerns about the security of Atlas and we have addressed them in a [tweet posted by our official account](https://twitter.com/AtlasOS/status/1651284816489336832?s=20). We will be working on making Atlas secure as the project goes along! Thank you for your patience.

## :material-head-question-outline: What is Atlas?

Atlas is a open source, and transparent project, that modifies Windows, and removes all of the negative drawbacks that affect gaming performance.

We are a great option for reducing system latency, network latency, input lag, and keeping your system private while still keeping our focus on performance.

Here are some resources to help you with your Atlas journey:

* [Getting started](/getting-started/) [(Installation)](/getting-started/installation/)
* [Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting/)
* [FAQ](/faq/)
