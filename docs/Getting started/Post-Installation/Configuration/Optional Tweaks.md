These are some cool tweaks that you can turn on. For example, you could change the old alt-tab to the new one or bring back the old one. You can pick and use any of the options.

All of the configuration files are located in the `3. Configuration/4. Optional Tweaks` folder. In your Atlas folder on your Desktop. If you have managed to misplace this folder you can download it via our [GitHub](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/Atlas/tree/main/src/Executables/Atlas) or find it in `C:/Users/default/Desktop/`.

## :material-swap-horizontal-circle-outline: Alt-Tab

Alt-Tab is a folder that lets you choose whether to use the new Alt-Tab menu or the old one. The new one is used in Windows 10, and the old one is used in Windows 7.

AtlasOS comes with the Legacy Alt-Tab, but you can run the ``Modern Alt-Tab.reg`` file to get the modern one.

This is another folder that lets you change how your default file explorer works. Here, we'll talk about each option.

You can change the folders that are shown by default in File Explorer's "This PC" section. Run the ``Remove all folders in This PC (default).reg`` or ``Restore all folders in This PC.reg`` files to remove or add all folders from this section.

You can also use the "Remove each folder" and "Restore each folder" folders to get rid of or bring back each folder.

By running the ``Network Pane.reg`` file, you can enable or disable the network pane.

## :material-menu: Send To Context Menu

With the ``Debloat Send To Context Menu.cmd`` file, you can reduce the items in the "Send to context" menu.

## :material-folder-text: Shortcut Text

By default, this is turned off, but you can turn it back on by running the ``Restore Shortcut Text.reg`` file. This will show the text of start menu shortcuts.

## :material-star-four-points: Visual Effects

If you click on the "Configure Visual Effects" file, it will take you to the page in Windows Settings for visual effects. On this page, you can change the way your AtlasOS installation looks and feels visually.

This lets you switch between the legacy and modern looks for the volume flyout. By default, AtlasOS uses the new one, but you can change that by running the ``Old Volume Flyout.reg`` file.
