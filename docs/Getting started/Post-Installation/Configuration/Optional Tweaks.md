These are some cool tweaks that you can turn on. For example, you could change the old alt-tab to the new one or bring back the old one. You can pick and use any of the options.

## :material-gamepad-variant-outline: Game Mode

Game Mode is a new feature in Windows 10 that lets you make your system work better for gaming, but it can also make some games run slower.

It does this by turning off services and background processes that aren't needed for gaming. It also lets you change the resolution and refresh rate of your game to suit your needs.

By default, this is turned off, but you can turn it on by running the ``Enable Game Mode.reg`` file. This can be found in the folder called "Game Mode."

By running the ``Network Pane.reg`` file, you can enable or disable the network pane.

This lets you switch between the legacy and modern looks for the volume flyout. By default, AtlasOS uses the new one, but you can change that by running the ``Old Volume Flyout.reg`` file.
