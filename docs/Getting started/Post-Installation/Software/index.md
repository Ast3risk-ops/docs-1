# Installing Software

AtlasOS makes it easy to install software. We've given you two quick ways to download software right from AtlasOS:

- [Scoop](Scoop.md)
- [Chocolatey](Chocolatey.md)

One has more options than the other, but they both work just as well. We try to list equal alternatives when we can.

Just open the ``Desktop/Atlas/Software Installation`` folder and run "Install Software.ps1" to install software, and follow the options.
