# Welcome to the AtlasOS documentation contributing guide

**Read here first:** https://docs.atlasos.net/contributions

Thank you for being invested in helping out AtlasOS and our documentation. This is amazingly useful to us and we appreciate it a lot!

Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

## How to use Markdown and MkDocs

We use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) for our documentation. If you are new to Markdown, we recommend reading the [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to get started.

We also use [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to build our documentation. If you are new to MkDocs, we recommend reading the [MkDocs documentation](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to get started.

The theme we use for [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). If you are new to Material for MkDocs, we recommend reading the [Material for MkDocs documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) to get started. You can find lots of useful information on styling, and how to use MkDocs to your best.

We use the [Insiders edition of Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/insiders/), so do not worry about formatting or feature limitations when creating documentation. Keep in mind that you'll need your own copy of Material for MkDocs Insiders to build and preview the documentation locally with the right formatting and features support.  Alternatively, you can temporarily comment out all of the insider only features in the MkDocs configuration.

## Issues

If you find any issues with our documentation, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Atlas-OS/docs/issues/new). Please fill issues out with utmost detail and preferably images too so we can understand where we went wrong or so contributors can make a pull request to fix the issue.
